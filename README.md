install axios and add getTVL.js file

What this file does is grab data from the subgraph, put it into an object, destructure that object to isolate an array, put the array into 'Date TVL(in millions)' format, and then print it to the console.

The file should be reworked into a function that returns the array and into a module that exports the function to be used with a React app.
